# SearchArtistAlbum
This is a simple app that searches for the album released by various artist and shows album artwork with artist profile and some release information.

I created this app just after learning some **Android programming**
This app uses Cloud API provided by [DISCOGS](https://www.discogs.com). You can see API usage [here](https://www.discogs.com/developers/) .
As this was developed just for fun and in the process of learning **Android**, the app is not scheduled to be published in Play store.

This app makes use of following concepts in **Android** 
*  AsyncTask & Threading
*  JSON & Cloud API
*  HTML Parsing
*  RecylerView and CardView
*  Views handling

Below is the screenshot of the app listing albums:
